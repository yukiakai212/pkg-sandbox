> 📦 Test your npm package as if it was published.

**No more mocks. No more local imports. This tool makes your test environment behave like your package was already live on the npm registry.**

---

## ✨ What it does

- ✅ Test your package installation using real install behavior
- ✅ Allows you to use normal imports in your test cases, just like if the package were published


---

## 🚀 Install & Use

```bash
npm install --save-dev pkg-sandbox
```

Then you can use it with the command:

```bash
npx sandbox [options]

#basic use
npx sandbox
```

Then use your library in tests exactly like real-world usage:

```ts
import { yourFn } from 'your-lib-name';
```
---

## 🧪 Example workflow (Vitest)

```ts
// test/my-lib.test.ts
import { resolvePath } from 'your-lib-name';

it('resolves correctly', () => {
  expect(resolvePath('vitest')).toMatch(/node_modules/);
});
```

You can now test everything just like real users would.

---

## 📦 Why not use ./dist?

Because they don't reflect real publish behavior.

`pkg-sandbox` gives you a fully realistic environment where your package behaves exactly like it's published.

It does **not** run your test cases — it just sets up a real-world install so that your tests can catch:

- Broken `main` or `exports` paths
- Invalid subpath imports (like `'lib/special.js'`)
- Missing files excluded by `.npmignore` or `files`
- Incorrect or missing type definitions

## 📌 When to use

- Before publishing your package
- In CI/CD to ensure it installs cleanly — this tests the actual install behavior
- To validate `exports`, `types`, and `package.json` correctness as seen by real users
- Catch missing files, broken exports, or invalid types — before your users do.
